The PyBank Python script analyzes a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

The PyBank Python script analyzes the records to calculate:
    
* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses"

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits

* The greatest decrease in profits
